# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
It felt good to come across these challenges knowing I have the skills to complete them it was about making them all work together
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Its going well im staying focused and getting into a good flow but I think i need to make work on taking more breaks or even just one longer break
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I need to review the content to solidify my understanding of each topic and do some practice problems of my own.
